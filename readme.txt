A Widget to show your latest Tweets.
Visit the option page "Plugins->Widget Embed Last Plugin" to authentify yourself


== Description ==

A Widget to show your latest tweets. Use the oEmbed methode and some cache. It is simple, elegant and it works.

This plugin uses the Twitter API version 1.1. You have to authentify yourself !
Visit the option page "Plugins->Widget Embed Last Plugin" to do so.

Options :

* Number of Tweet to display
* Maximum width
* Alignment (left, right, center, none)
* Choose your language
* Hide the original message in the case that the embedded Tweet is a reply
* Hide images in the Tweet

Note that with the oEmbed method you can not customise easily the display of your Tweet.
However, the oEmbed method ensures you that all Twitter's recommendations for displaying your tweet are respected, they are providing the code !

Sorry no. With the embed method from Twitter you can't really customise the display of your tweet.
